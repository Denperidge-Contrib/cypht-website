        <h1>Getting Started with Cypht Community</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Cypht community! We are excited to have you join us and become a part of our mission to
            develop and improve Cypht. This documentation is designed to help you get started with our community,
            understand the development process, and contribute effectively to the project.
        </p>
        <h2>About the Cypht Community</h2>
        <h3 class="h3">What is Cypht?</h3>
        <p>
            Cypht is an open-source email client and news aggregator with a modular design. Unlike traditional
            applications, Cypht is built entirely from plugins, or "module sets," with the core modules being
            essential. Users can customize their experience by adding or replacing modules to suit specific site
            requirements. This modular approach offers flexibility and easy customization, although it may introduce
            complexity.
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">Our Values</h3>
        <p>
            As a community, we prioritize collaboration, inclusivity, and transparency. We encourage respect for
            others and open communication. Our goal is to create a welcoming environment for all developers,
            regardless of experience levels.
        </p>
